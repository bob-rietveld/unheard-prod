## 💡 Unique Value Propositions

### **Problem: Founders Face Complex Decisions**

**Before**:
- 40 minutes to set up experiment (parameter hell)
- 10 minutes to run (sequential LLM calls)
- Synthetic personas (unreliable)
- No validation methodology
- Manual analysis (biased)
- Scattered documentation
- Hard to collaborate with co-founders/advisors

**After (Unheard V2)**:
- 2 minutes conversational setup (AI agent guides)
- 30 seconds to run (parallelized)
- Real personas (from actual company data)
- Template-driven best practices
- Automated insight extraction
- Git-versioned decisions (full history)
- GitHub collaboration (built-in)

**Result**: **20x faster time to actionable insight + team collaboration**

## 📈 Market Opportunity

### **Target Market: Founders & Startup Teams**

**TAM**:
- 5.4M startups globally
- 50M small businesses in US alone
- Average 2-3 co-founders per startup

**Target Segments**:
- Pre-seed/seed founders (fundraising decisions)
- Product founders (roadmap, pricing, features)
- Growth-stage founders (operations, hiring, strategy)

**Pricing**:
- Solo Founder: $49/month
- Team (2-5): $149/month
- Enterprise (5+): $299/month

**Differentiators**:
1. Template-driven (no parameter hell)
2. Conversational UI (Claude Desktop UX)
3. Context-grounded personas (not made-up)
4. Git-based collaboration (founder-friendly)
5. Cloud execution (fast parallel processing)

### **Revenue Potential**

```
Year 1:
  200 founders × $49/month × 12 = $117,600 ARR
  50 teams × $149/month × 12 = $89,400 ARR
  Total: $207,000 ARR

Year 2:
  1,000 founders × $49/month × 12 = $588,000 ARR
  300 teams × $149/month × 12 = $536,400 ARR
  Total: $1,124,400 ARR

Year 3:
  5,000 founders × $49/month × 12 = $2,940,000 ARR
  1,500 teams × $149/month × 12 = $2,682,000 ARR
  Total: $5,622,000 ARR
```

## ❓ Key Architectural Decisions

### **1. Why Tauri vs Electron?**

**Tauri Wins**:
- ✅ 15MB bundle (vs 200MB)
- ✅ 80MB memory (vs 400MB)
- ✅ Rust security (memory-safe)
- ✅ Native Git integration (git2 crate)
- ✅ Already invested (foundation built)

**Trade-offs**:
- ❌ Rust learning curve → Mitigated by AI assistance
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem → Mitigated by active community

### **2. Why Local Agent + Cloud Execution?**

**Hybrid Architecture**:
- ✅ Chat needs instant responses (<200ms) → Local Claude SDK
- ✅ Experiments need parallelization → Cloud Modal
- ✅ Privacy (context stays local until sent to cloud)
- ✅ Offline capability (chat works, experiments queue)

### **3. Why Git/GitHub Integration?**

**Version Control for Decisions**:
- ✅ Natural versioning (every decision is a commit)
- ✅ Collaboration (GitHub's UX for comments)
- ✅ Branching (try scenarios without losing work)
- ✅ Diffs (see what changed between experiments)
- ✅ Data ownership (founders own their repo)
- ✅ Export-friendly (everything is flat files)

### **4. Why Template-Driven?**

**Solve Parameter Hell**:
- ✅ Founders don't know what to configure
- ✅ Templates encode best practices
- ✅ 2-minute setup vs 30-minute manual
- ✅ Consistent, reusable workflows
- ✅ Community can contribute templates

## 💰 Investment Required

### **Development Costs (8 weeks)**

Assuming 1 developer:
```
Salary: $150K/year = $2,885/week
8 weeks × $2,885 = $23,080 total labor

Services:
- Claude API: ~$100/month × 2 = $200
- Convex (free tier): $0
- Modal (free tier): $0
- GitHub: $0 (public repo)

Total: ~$23,300
```

Assuming 2 developers (parallel, 5 weeks):
```
2 × $2,885/week × 5 weeks = $28,850
Services: ~$300
Total: ~$29,150
```

### **Break-even Analysis**

```
Development Cost: $29,150
Monthly Cost per Customer: ~$10 (Claude API + Convex + Modal)

Break-even at:
  $49/month plan: 50 customers ($2,450/month gross)
  After costs: ~$1,950/month net
  ROI: 15 months to break even

Year 1 (200 customers):
  Revenue: $117,600
  Costs: $29,150 (dev) + $24,000 (ops) = $53,150
  Profit: $64,450
  ROI: 2.2x
```
